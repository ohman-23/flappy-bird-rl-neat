# TODO:
# set up a game that can be played purely by the AI from command line (view results of the project)
# clean up classes (make them readable)
# TODO: Argparse Add options to construct the neural network
# TODO: make sure you implement the ENUM for mating stuff
# TODO: APPLY THE NEAT LIBRARY, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT IN THE FUTURE!
# TODO: Create a method of saving the best bird

# LESSONS:
# - For neural networks - preturbations of weights or changing connections per generation
#   is good for genetic algorithms

# - In general, neural network weights of -1 to 1 are best (to protect against exploding grads)
# - TanH is a great activation function!
# - For GA Stuff, you have to really think about how best to MATE/CROSS POLLINATE generations!
# - For GA Stuff, you also have to be very specific about how you define your fitness function
#   you can influence behavior of children based on what you attribute as good and bad behavior
